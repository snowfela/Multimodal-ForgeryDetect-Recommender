# Forgery-Aware Multi-modal Recommender  

## Project Overview  

This project addresses two critical challenges in the e-commerce industry:  
1. Delivering highly personalized and context-aware recommendations.  
2. Ensuring product authenticity through advanced forgery detection mechanisms.  

The solution integrates a **hybrid multimodal recommendation system** combining:  
- Content-based filtering  
- Collaborative filtering  
- Context-aware recommendations  
- Multimodal recommendations using **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)**  
- Forgery detection using **FD-GAN (Forgery Detection via Generative Adversarial Networks)**  

By blending recommendation accuracy with authenticity verification, the system aims to redefine the online shopping experience as **personalized, secure, and trustworthy**.

## Key Features  

1. **Content-based Filtering**:  
   - Uses past interactions, likes, and preferences to create a personalized user profile for recommending similar products.  

2. **Collaborative Filtering**:  
   - Leverages user behavior patterns to suggest items liked by users with similar interests.  

3. **Context-aware Recommendations**:  
   - Factors like location, time, device type, and purchase history refine the recommendations.  

4. **Multimodal Recommendations (CLIP)**:  
   - Combines textual and visual data for enhanced relevance and accuracy in recommendations.  

5. **Forgery Detection (FD-GAN)**:  
   - Detects counterfeit product images during seller registration.  
   - Reconstructs original images when forgeries are identified, ensuring only authentic products reach users.

## Project Objectives  

- Design a hybrid framework incorporating content-based, collaborative, and context-aware personalization techniques.  
- Enhance search accuracy and ranking by fusing textual and visual data.  
- Develop a robust forgery detection module for verifying product authenticity.  
- Improve user satisfaction with personalized, context-sensitive recommendations.

## System Workflow  

1. **User Interface (UI)**:  
   - Users interact with the platform to search, browse, and purchase products.  

2. **Data Collection and Processing**:  
   - User actions are recorded and processed to create detailed profiles and datasets for recommendations.  

3. **Recommendation Engine**:  
   - Combines content-based, collaborative, context-aware, and multimodal techniques to deliver tailored suggestions.  

4. **Forgery Detection Module**:  
   - Uses FD-GAN to verify the authenticity of product images during seller registration, ensuring only legitimate products are listed.  

5. **Feedback Loop**:  
   - Continuously improves recommendations based on user interactions, analytics, and satisfaction metrics.
